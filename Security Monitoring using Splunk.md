## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Part 1: Install Splunk on Ubuntu Server (Main Splunk Server)**

#### **Step 1: Install Virtualization Platform**
1. Download and install your preferred virtualization platform:
   - [VirtualBox Installation Guide](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html)  
   - [VMware Workstation Pro Guide](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/resources.html)  
   - [Proxmox VE Installation Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_Proxmox_VE)  


#### **Step 3: Update Ubuntu on Both VMs**
1. After installation, log in to both servers and update the packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
#### **Step 4: Install Splunk on Main Server**
1.  Download and install Splunk Enterprise:
  ```
  wget -O splunk-9.4.0-6b4ebe426ca6-linux-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.4.0/linux/splunk-9.4.0-6b4ebe426ca6-linux-amd64.deb"
  sudo dpkg -i splunk-9.4.0-6b4ebe426ca6-linux-amd64.deb
  cd /opt/splunk/bin
  sudo ./splunk start
  ```
2. Make splunk accesible via internet (optional)
```
  nano /opt/splunk/etc/splunk-launch.conf
  SPLUNK_BINDIP=0.0.0.0 //add this
```
3. Add port 8000 in firewall
   ```
   ufw allow 8000/tcp
   ```
4. Access Splunk via the web interface:
  ```
  http://<Splunk_Server_IP>:8000
```
  ### Part 2: Configure Syslog Collection from the Second Ubuntu Server
 #### Step 6: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on Syslog Server
  1. Download Splunk Universal Forwarder:
  ```
  wget -O splunkforwarder-9.4.0-6b4ebe426ca6-linux-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.4.0/linux/splunkforwarder-9.4.0-6b4ebe426ca6-linux-amd64.deb"
  ```
  2. Install the Universal Forwarder:
  ```
  sudo dpkg -i splunkforwarder-9.4.0-6b4ebe426ca6-linux-amd64.deb
  ```
  3. Start the Splunk Universal Forwarder and accept the license:
  ```
  sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk start --accept-license
  sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk enable boot-start
  ```
  4. Configure Splunk Forwarder to send logs to the Splunk server:
  ```
  sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add forward-server <Splunk_Server_IP>:9997 -auth admin:<your_password>
  ```
  #### Step 7: Configure Syslog Monitoring on Syslog Server
  1. Create a directory to store syslog files:
  ```
  sudo mkdir -p /var/log/syslog
  ```
  2. Configure rsyslog to output logs to /var/log/syslog. Edit the rsyslog configuration file:
  ```
  sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
  ```
  - Uncomment or add:
  ```
  *.* /var/log/syslog
  ```
  - Restart rsyslog:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
  ```
  #### Step 8: Add Syslog Directory to Splunk Universal Forwarder Inputs
  1. Add the syslog directory as a monitored input:
  ```
  sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log/syslog
  ```
  #### Step 9: Configure Splunk Server to Receive Logs
  1. On the Splunk server, enable receiving:
  ```
  sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable listen 9997
  ```
  2. Verify the forwarder connection:
  ```
  sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk list forward-server
  ```
  #### Step 10: Search for Syslogs in Splunk
  1. Access Splunk via the web interface:
  ```
  http://<Splunk_Server_IP>:8000
  ```
  2. Navigate to Search & Reporting and search for incoming logs using:
  ```
  index=_internal OR index=main
  ```

   ### Part 3: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on a Windows Machine
   #### Step 1: Download and Install Splunk Universal Forwarder
   Download the Splunk Universal Forwarder for Windows:
   Splunk UF for Windows
   Run the installer and follow the setup wizard:
   Accept the license agreement.
   Choose the installation directory.
   Provide the Splunk server IP and receiving port (e.g., 9997).
   #### Step 2: Add Monitored Inputs on Windows
   Launch the Splunk Universal Forwarder Configuration utility.
   Add directories or files to monitor (e.g., Event Logs, system logs).
   #### Step 3: Verify Forwarding to Splunk
   - On the Splunk server, verify that the Windows machine is forwarding logs:
 ```
   sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk list forward-server
  ```
   - Search for Windows logs in Splunk's Search & Reporting app:
   ```
   index=windows_logs
   ```
