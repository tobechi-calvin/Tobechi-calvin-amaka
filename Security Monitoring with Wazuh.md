## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Set Up Wazuh Manager**  
   - Install and update the Ubuntu server for the manager role:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - Install Wazuh using the one-line command:  
     ```bash
     curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
     ```
   - Access the Wazuh Dashboard via a web browser:  
     ```
     https://<server-ip>:5601
     ```
   - Log in using the credentials displayed during the installation process.

### 2. **Set Up Wazuh Agent on Another Ubuntu Server**  
   - On the **second Ubuntu server**, update the packages:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - Install the Wazuh Agent using the following command:  
     ```bash
     curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-agent.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-agent.sh -a -s <WAZUH_MANAGER_IP>
     ```
   - Replace `<WAZUH_MANAGER_IP>` with the IP address of the Wazuh Manager server.  

### 3. **Configure Wazuh Agent**  
   - Open the agent configuration file:  
     ```bash
     sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
     ```
   - Ensure the `<address>` tag contains the correct Wazuh Manager IP:  
     ```xml
     <address><WAZUH_MANAGER_IP></address>
     ```
   - Restart the agent to apply changes:  
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
     ```

### 4. **Verify Agent Connection on Wazuh Manager**  
   - Log in to the Wazuh Dashboard.  
   - Navigate to **Agents** under the **Management** tab.  
   - Confirm the agent appears in the list and is marked as **Active**.
