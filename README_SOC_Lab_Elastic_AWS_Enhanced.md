## 🔧 Project Overview
As part of a hands, I designed and deployed a fully functional **Security Operations Center (SOC)** lab environment in AWS. This project demonstrates my ability to build, configure, and monitor infrastructure for real-time threat detection and log analysis using the **Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet)**.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Summary
- **Elastic & Kibana**: Centralized log collection and visualization.
- **Fleet Server**: Manages Elastic Agents across endpoints.
- **Elastic Agents**: Deployed on both Linux (SSH) and Windows (RDP) servers to collect and forward logs.
- **OS Ticket Server**: Simulates incident management by receiving alert notifications.
- **SOC Analyst Workstation**: Accesses Kibana dashboard via web GUI.
- **Attacker Infrastructure (Kali & C2 Server)**: Simulates external threat actors for testing detection.

**VPC Configuration:**
- Private Subnet: `172.31.0.0/24`
- Elastic Stack and agents deployed within this network on AWS EC2 instances.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Setup Highlights

✅ **Installed Java 11 (OpenJDK)** to support Elasticsearch/Kibana  
📌 *Screenshot:*

---

✅ **Successfully deployed and validated services**:
- `elasticsearch.service` → ✅ *Active*
- `kibana.service` → ✅ *Active*

---

✅ **Customized AWS Security Group rules** for ports:  
- `443` (HTTPS for Kibana)  
- `9200` (Elasticsearch REST API)  
- `22` (SSH), `3389` (RDP)

✅ **Created a Fleet Server and enrolled agents from:**
- Windows Server (RDP)
- Ubuntu Server (SSH)

---

## 🔍 Detection & Monitoring
- **Live log data visualization** through Kibana (`logs-*` index pattern)
- Monitored fields like `agent.name`, `cloud.account.id`, `timestamp`, etc.
- Elastic Agent logs confirm successful communication with the Fleet server

## 🧪 Next Phase
- Simulate attacker activity from Kali Linux (e.g., reverse shell or brute force)
- Detect and alert on suspicious behavior using **Elastic Security**
- Forward alerts to the **OS Ticket System** for incident triaging
- Add ingest pipelines and detection rules via **Kibana Security Module**
